# Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD) Risk Analysis in KwaZulu-Natal

## Overview

This project presents a geospatial and machine learning-based analysis of Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD) risk across KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.

The study integrates GIS-derived spatial variables with a Random Forest classification model to identify municipalities at elevated risk of FMD outbreaks.

## Objectives

Map the spatial distribution of FMD outbreaks

Quantify key spatial risk factors

Develop a composite risk intensity index

Apply machine learning to predict outbreak occurrence

## Methodology

### Spatial Analysis

The following geospatial variables were derived:

Road density

Distance to the Disease Management Area (DMA)

Distance to protected areas at the wildlife–livestock interface

Risk Index

The FMD risk intensity index was defined as:

R_i = (1/3)(RD_i + D_DMA,i* + D_PA,i*)

Where:
RD_i = normalized road density
D_DMA,i* = normalized inverse distance to DMA
D_PA,i* = normalized inverse distance to protected areas

Higher values indicate greater relative outbreak risk.

### Machine Learning Model

A Random Forest classifier was used to predict outbreak presence.

Features:

road_norm

dma_norm

protected_area_norm

Target:

outbreak_present
